				<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">ACCEPTANCE</h4>
				<p>You’re warmly welcome to visit us at Caterdaay (“Caterdaay,” “we,” or “us”) and our website at Caterdaay.com, along with our related services, websites, networks, and applications, provided by us (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
				<p>Please read the following terms carefully. By using the service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions, including the Caterdaay privacy policy (together, the “terms”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.</p>
                <p>These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Caterdaay will be resolved by binding arbitration. You agree to give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review Section 20 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration”) for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Caterdaay.</p>
				<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">AGREEMENT</h4>
				<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Caterdaay and Customers regarding the Service, and supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Caterdaay and Customers regarding the same. The original, legally binding version of this document is written in English. If it is translated into other languages by non-native English-speakers or by software, there may be discrepancies between the English version and the translated version.

				<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">CATERDAAY SERVICE OVERVIEW</h4>
				<p>The Service we provide connects businesses that are looking for catering services (“Customers”) with restaurants, Caterers and businesses seeking to provide food, beverage, and catering delivery services (“Vendors”) through online accepting orders and delivery services.</p>
				<p>Caterdaay doesn’t provide delivery service; we hire services of the third party which provide delivery services to deliver food ordered through Caterdaay. Those delivery services are independent of Caterdaay and are subject to laws, regulations and rules regarding their services. Through the website and mobile application, Customers may search, select order and pick up their order, and coordinate with us to take delivery services. Customers can provide feedback among other features. Customers understand that Caterdaay is not a caterer, restaurant, or other food preparer platform (each a “Food Prepare”). Caterdaay hire services of independent Food Prepares available through our Platform. That Food Prepares are subject to laws, regulation, and rules regarding their services.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">GOVERNING LAW</h4>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province/State of Ontario without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then Customer and Caterdaay agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Ontario for the purpose of litigating any dispute.

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">GENERAL</h4>
<p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Caterdaay regarding your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. </p>



<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h4>
<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Caterdaay in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Caterdaay agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these terms, you and Caterdaay are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by e-mail (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”).  customersupport@caterdaay.com </p>
<p>The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Caterdaay may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Caterdaay must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Caterdaay will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Caterdaay in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Consent to Electronic Communications</h4>
<p>By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>
